End goal: Communicate between various peers that have at most 3 direct 
	connections, but utilizing "gossip" to create a network table that 
	then has djikstra's algorithim run on it to find best route from 
	peer A to peer B. The network is based on docker with each peer 
	utilizing a sepearate docker container on one docker network.
	
TODO:
	Build test DONE
	Peer files connect to eachother over docker DONE
	Create data structures for direct peers and nav table
	Implement D's A to find optimal route
	Create system test that automatically takes a random destination 
	for each host, then run system and send file

	Final implement: create local networks (several users within one 
	container) that then communicate with other local networks (find
	a local user on a seperate container from current container)
